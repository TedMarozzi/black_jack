Welcome to my Simple Black Jack game!

The game is designed to be played in a best of five format and thus
whoever has the most wins after five games is declared the winner.
The goal is to get beat the dealer. In order to do this you must
obtain a score higher than the dealers score, while staying below 
or equal to 21.

Rules:
1) Click on the deck to draw a card, your total card value is displayed
	in the upper left corner.
	
2) You must now decide to either click the hold button or to draw again.

3) If you draw again and your total score is over 21 you automatically
	lose that round, unless the last card you drew was an ace, if you
	draw an ace that makes you bust, then aces value is defaulted to 1.
	
4) Once you are happy with your score press the hold button and the 
	dealer will begin to play. If the dealer obtains a the same score as you,
	you draw. If the dealer goes over 21 you win. If the gets better than 
	your score but less than or equal to 21 you loss.

5) Once five games are played the window will automatically close it self.
	
6) Good Luck and have fun!

Card Values:
ace = 11 or 1 (If 11 makes you go bust, then the value is defaulted to 1).
two to ten = face value of the card.
jack, queen, king = 10
